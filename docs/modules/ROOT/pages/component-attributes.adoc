= Assign Attributes to a Component Version

You can apply attributes to all of the pages in a component version by declaring them in the [.path]_antora.yml_ file for that component version.

== Component version attributes

Attributes that are defined in a component version descriptor are referred to as [.term]*component version attributes*.
Component version attributes can be xref:page:attributes.adoc[built-in, custom, and page attributes].
These attributes are applied and available (or made unavailable if unset) to all of a component version's pages according to the <<precedence-rules,attribute precedence rules>>.
If an attribute was previously xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[hard set or hard unset in the site's playbook], *its declaration in a component version descriptor will have no impact*.

[#hard-set]
== Set attributes in antora.yml

Component version attributes are set in a component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file.
First, the `asciidoc` and `attributes` keys must be set.
Then, each component version attribute is entered on its own line as a key-value pair under `attributes`.

.Declare attributes in antora.yml
[#ex-hard-set,yaml]
----
name: light
title: Data Light
version: '2.3'
asciidoc: # <.>
  attributes: # <.>
    table-caption: Data Set # <.>
    hide-uri-scheme: '' # <.>
    page-level: Advanced # <.>
    page-category: Statistics; Cloud Infrastructure # <.>
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
----
<.> On a new line, type `asciidoc`, followed by a colon (`:`), and press kbd:[Enter].
<.> Nest the `attributes` key on the line directly underneath the `asciidoc` key.
Type `attributes`, followed by a colon (`:`), and press kbd:[Enter].
<.> Each component version attribute is nested under the `attributes` key and defined on its own line.
Type the name of the attribute, followed by a colon (`:`).
Press the kbd:[spacebar] once after the colon, then type the value of the attribute.
<.> To assign the default value, or in the case of a boolean attribute, the _empty string_ value, to a built-in attribute, type two consecutive single quotation marks (`''`) in the value field.
<.> To declare a custom page attribute, type `page-` and the name of your attribute, followed by a colon (`:`).
Press kbd:[spacebar] once after the colon, then enter the value of the attribute.
<.> When an attribute has multiple, independent values, separate each value with a semicolon (`;`).

A set component version attribute is applied and available to every page that belongs to the component version.
The values of custom attributes, such as `page-level`, can be displayed in a page using the attribute reference syntax (e.g., `+{page-level}+`).

The attributes in <<ex-hard-set>> are all hard set.
[.term]*Hard set* component version attributes cannot be overridden from a page.
By default, an attribute is hard set when it's assigned a value that isn't reserved for unsetting the attribute (i.e., `false` or `~`) and doesn't end with a modifier (i.e., `@`).
To allow a page to modify or unset a component version attribute, you need to <<soft-set,soft set the component version attribute>>.

[#soft-set]
=== Soft set attributes

Soft set component version attributes can be overridden from a page.
An attribute is soft set by attaching the `@` modifier to the end of its value.

.Assign soft set precedence to attributes
[#ex-soft-set,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    table-caption: Data Set@ # <.>
    hide-uri-scheme: '@' # <.>
----
<.> To soft set an attribute that's assigned an explicit value, attach the `@` modifier to the end of its value.
<.> To soft set and assign a built-in attribute's default value, or in the case of a boolean attribute, the _empty string_ value, type an opening single quotation mark, followed by the `@` modifier, and then a closing single quotation mark (`'`).

Since the component version attributes in <<ex-soft-set>> are soft set, a page could modify their values or unset them.

[#references-in-values]
=== Reference a component version attributes in attribute values

The value of a component version attribute can contain an attribute reference to a xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[site attribute] or another component version attribute already set in the same [.path]_antora.yml_ file using the AsciiDoc attribute reference syntax (e.g., `+{site-title}+`, `+{page-level}+`).

.Reference a component version attribute in a component version attribute value
[#ex-attribute-value-references,yaml]
----
name: light
title: Data Light
version: '2.3'
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    table-caption: Data Set
    url-plugins: https://example.com/plugins
    url-data-plugin: {url-plugins}/data-light
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
----

A component version attribute can also be referenced in the value of a xref:page:attributes.adoc[page attribute].

To prevent an attribute reference substitution in an attribute value, insert a backslash in front of the reference (e.g., `+\{not-substituted}+`).
In this case, the attribute reference will not be substituted and the backslash will be omitted.

[#hard-unset]
== Unset attributes in antora.yml

Attributes can also be unset.
Component version attributes are hard unset when they're assigned the reserved tilde symbol (`~`) value.
Each attribute is entered on its own line as a key-value pair under the `attributes` key.

.Hard unset attributes
[#ex-hard-unset,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    table-caption: ~ # <.>
    hide-uri-scheme: ~ # <.>
----
<.> To hard unset an attribute, assign it the tilde symbol (`~`).
The `~` is a reserved value that hard unsets a component version attribute.
<.> Boolean attributes are also hard unset when assigned the tilde symbol (`~`).

[.term]*Hard unset* component version attributes cannot be overridden from a page.
When a component version attribute is hard unset, its behavior is turned off and it isn't available to the component version's pages.

[#soft-unset]
=== Soft unset attributes

Soft unset component version attributes can be overridden from a page.
An attribute is soft unset by assigning it the reserved value `false`.

.Assign soft unset precedence to attributes
[#ex-soft-unset,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    table-caption: false # <.>
    hide-uri-scheme: false # <.>
----
<.> To soft unset an attribute, assign it the value `false`.
<.> Boolean attributes are also soft unset when assigned `false`.

Since the attributes in <<ex-soft-unset>> are soft unset, a page could reset them.

[#precedence-rules]
== Precedence rules

Antora takes the precedence assigned to xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[site attributes] into account first.
An attribute declared in an [.path]_antora.yml_ file cannot override the same attribute if it's hard set or hard unset in a playbook.
A component version attribute can override a site attribute *only if the site attribute is soft set or unset*.

When component version attributes are declared, you can control whether a page can reset or unset each attribute on a case by case basis.
Assuming that the attribute was soft set or unset, or wasn't previously defined in a playbook, then component version attributes that are hard set or hard unset can't be changed by a page.
However, soft set and unset component version attributes can be overridden from a page.

. <<hard-set,Hard setting>> a component version attribute using a string value with no trailing `@` modifier (e.g., `value` or `''`) prevents a page from changing or unsetting the attribute.
. <<soft-set,Soft setting>> a component version attribute using a string value with a trailing `@` modifier (e.g., `value@` or `'@'`) allows a page to change or unset the attribute.
. <<hard-unset,Hard unsetting>> a component version attribute using the tilde symbol (`~`) prevents a page from setting the attribute.
. <<soft-unset,Soft unsetting>> a component version attribute using a `false` value allows a page to set the attribute.

To learn more about how component version attributes interact with site attributes and page attributes, see xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[] and xref:page:attributes.adoc[].

[#intrinsic]
== Intrinsic component version attributes

Antora defines intrinsic page attributes from most of the keys in a component version descriptor file.
For instance, Antora sets the built-in attribute `page-component-title` and assigns it the value specified by the `title` key.
See xref:page:intrinsic-attributes.adoc#page-attributes[Intrinsic page attributes] for a complete list of the page attributes Antora automatically declares.

Antora also sets some built-in AsciiDoc attributes, such as `sectanchors`, by default.
See xref:page:intrinsic-attributes.adoc#site-and-configuration-attributes[Site and configuration attributes] for more information.
