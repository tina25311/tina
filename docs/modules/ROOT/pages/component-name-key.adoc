= Name Key

A component name is defined by assigning a value to the `name` key.

== What's a component name?

A [.term]*component name*, also called [.term]*name*, is the value assigned to the `name` key in a component version descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_).
A component name typically represents the name of a project, library, service, etc., such as `fauna`, `rudder`, `nrepl`, etc.
The value of a `name` key, in combination with the value of a `version` key, defines a xref:component-version.adoc[component version].

[#usage]
=== How Antora uses name

The component name is fundamental to many of Antora's operations.
Antora uses the name:

* as the xref:how-antora-builds-urls.adoc#component[component segment] in page and asset URLs, unless <<root-component,the name of the component is _ROOT_>>.

Additionally, if the component title key isn't set, Antora uses the name:

* to xref:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc[sort component versions]
* for display purposes in the reference UI, which includes the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component version page menu], xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector menu], and
the first breadcrumb position on a component version's pages

Note that component name is case sensitive.
This means that if you have two components with the same name that only are different in case, Antora will treat them as different components.

Content writers use the name as the xref:page:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-component[component coordinate in resource IDs] when referencing a resource in another documentation component.

[#key]
== name key

The `name` key is required.
It's set and assigned a value in a component version descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_).

.antora.yml with defined component name
[,yaml]
----
name: colorado # <.>
----
<.> At the beginning of a new line, type `name`, directly followed by a colon and a space (`:{sp}`).
Then type the value you want assigned to `name`.

[#requirements]
=== name requirements

The value assigned to the `name` key can contain letters, numbers, underscores (`+_+`), hyphens (`-`), and periods (`.`).
To ensure portability between host platforms, letters used in the `name` value should be lowercase.

IMPORTANT: We *strongly* encourage you to select a name that only consists of _lowercase_ characters.
Component names, except for <<root-component,the special _ROOT_ value>>, are used in your site's URLs, therefore, using consistent casing makes the component name, and thus your site, more portable.
That's because some file systems, and thus the web server running on it, can't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters.

The value *cannot* contain spaces, forward slashes (`/`), or HTML special characters (`&`, `<`, or `>`).
The value *cannot* be empty.

See xref:component-title.adoc[] to learn how to display a name that contains spaces, uppercase letters, and other characters in your site's UI.

[#root-component]
=== ROOT component

When a component's name is set to _ROOT_ and its version is set to `~` in its [.path]_antora.yml_, then that component will be placed directly at the site's root.
It will not be placed inside a folder named `ROOT`.
This is analogous to how modules named _ROOT_ are placed at the root of their component.

Like other components, a _ROOT_ component must have an [.path]_antora.yml_ file and a [.path]_modules_ folder.
Let's re-use the example from xref:module-url-segment#ex-modules[Module Segment in Page URLs]:

[listing#ex-modules]
----
📒 repository
  📄 antora.yml # name: ROOT and version: ~
  📂 modules
    📂 admin
      📂 pages
        📄 user-management.adoc
      📄 nav.adoc
    📂 ROOT
      📁 images
      📂 pages
        📄 deploy.adoc
        📄 index.adoc
      📄 nav.adoc
----

But now let's instead assume that this component is named _ROOT_ instead of _hyperlemur_, and its version set to `~`.
Here is what the URLs of the pages would be (assuming that `html_extension_style` is set to `default` in your playbook):

[.path]_repository/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc_:: \https://my-company.com/index.html (which means it will also be found at \https://my-company.com)
[.path]_repository/modules/ROOT/pages/deploy.adoc_:: \https://my-company.com/deploy.html
[.path]_repository/modules/admin/pages/user-management.adoc_:: \https://my-company.com/admin/user-management.html

Because both the component name _ROOT_ and the module name _ROOT_ are excluded from URLs, the pages in the _ROOT_ component's _ROOT_ module live directly at your site's root, with [.path]_root_component/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc_ serving as the site's home page.
That means that the index.adoc page in the ROOT module of the ROOT component acts as the site start page *without* having to specify it (no additional configuration is required).

If the ROOT component were to be versioned (i.e., have a non-empty version), then the files in that component version would be placed inside the version folder at the root of the site.

[CAUTION]
Because the _ROOT_ component's name does not appear in URLs, its modules are effectively scoped under your site's root.
This means it's possible for pages in the _ROOT_ component to conflict with pages in a named component.
For instance, the file [.path]_modules/xyz/pages/index.adoc_ in the (unversioned) _ROOT_ component and the file [.path]_modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc_ in the (unversioned) _xyz_ component will both resolve to the URL \https://my-company.com/xyz/index.html, which is invalid.
Therefore, you should be mindful of this situation when using modules in the _ROOT_ component.

Since _ROOT_ is not a user-friendly title for a component, you should also set the title in [.path]_antora.yml_, as demonstrated in xref:component-title.adoc[Customize the Title].

////
Antora uses the `name` key when interpreting resource IDs and generating the URLs for the component version's pages.
Unless the xref:component-title.adoc[title key is set], it uses `name` for sorting components in the component version selector and where ever the component's name is displayed in the reference UI, which includes the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component version page menu], xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector], and
the first breadcrumb position on a component version's pages.
