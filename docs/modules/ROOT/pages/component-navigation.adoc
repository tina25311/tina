= Assign Navigation Files to a Component Version

On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to register navigation files with the `nav` key in [.path]_antora.yml_.
* [x] How registration order affects the component version's page menu.

[#nav-key]
== nav key

The `nav` key is optional.
It's set in a component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file and accepts a list of xref:navigation:files-and-lists.adoc[navigation files].
Each value specifies the path to a navigation file (e.g., [.path]_modules/module-directory/nav-file.adoc_) relative to [.path]_antora.yml_.

.antora.yml that registers two navigation files
[,yaml]
----
name: colorado
title: Colorado âˆ†
version: '5.6'
nav: # <.>
- modules/get-started/nav.adoc # <.>
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc # <.>
----
<.> The `nav` key must be entered on its own line and be directly followed by a colon (`:`).
<.> Value registering a navigation file located in the [.path]_get-started_ module directory.
<.> Value registering a navigation file located in the [.path]_ROOT_ module directory.

Each value listed under `nav` must be structured as follows:

* Don't indent the values.
* Enter each value on its own line.
* Start each value with a hyphen (`-`), followed by a blank space.
* After the blank space, enter the path to an individual navigation file relative to the location of the [.path]_antora.yml_ file.

A navigation file is [.term]*registered* when it's assigned to the `nav` key.
Only the contents of registered navigation files are assembled into and published as the component version's page menu.
The order of the values dictates the order the contents of the navigation files are displayed in the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component version's page menu] on your site.
