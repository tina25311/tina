= Version Key
:description: A version is resolved from the version key in a component version descriptor file (antora.yml) or inherited from a content source in the playbook.
:mdash: &#8212;

A version is defined by assigning a value to the `version` key.
It's important to understand <<usage,how Antora uses the version>> and its related facets before committing to a versioning scheme.

== What's a version?

In Antora, a [.term]*version* is the value resolved from the `version` key in a component version descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_) or inherited from the content source in the playbook.
A version is a semantic or named identifier that represents a unique release or instance of the documentation for a project.
The resolved value of the `version` key, in combination with the value of the `name` key, defines a xref:component-version.adoc[component version].

Although the version is typically a literal value, it can also be interpreted.
The version can be defined as xref:component-with-no-version.adoc[unversioned] by assigning a tilde, `~`, to the `version` key.
The version can be configured as the refname in which it resides by assigning `true` to the `version` key.
The version can also be derived from the refname by assigning a map of refname projections to the `version` key.

Occasionally, the value assigned to the `version` key is referred to as the [.term]*actual version* in this documentation when a distinction between version and the other version facets--xref:version-facets.adoc#prerelease[prerelease], xref:version-facets.adoc#display[display], and xref:version-facets.adoc#symbolic[symbolic]{mdash}needs to be made in a description or example.

[#usage]
=== How Antora uses version

The version is fundamental to many of Antora's operations.
Antora uses the version:

* to xref:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc[sort component versions]
* identify the xref:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc#latest-version[latest version of a component]
* apply routing rules
* as the xref:how-antora-builds-urls.adoc#version[version segment] in publishable resource URLs, except when:
** the assigned value is the xref:component-with-no-version.adoc[tilde (~) that defines an unversioned component version]
** a component version is identified as the latest stable or latest prerelease version and the xref:playbook:urls-latest-version-segment.adoc[latest_version_segment key] or xref:playbook:urls-latest-prerelease-version-segment.adoc[latest_prerelease_version_segment key] is set in the playbook
* for display purposes in the reference UI xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector] and xref:navigation:index.adoc#page-dropdown[page version selector] menus, except when:
** the `display_version` key is set and assigned a value in the component version's [.path]_antora.yml_ file
** the `display_version` key is set by Antora at runtime because the xref:component-prerelease.adoc#identifier[prerelease key is assigned an identifier]

Content writers use the version as the xref:page:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-version[version coordinate in resource IDs] when referencing a resource in another component version.

[#key]
== version key

The `version` key accepts a named identifier, such as `jesse`, a semantic identifier, such as `'1.5.0'`, the reserved value `true`, a map of refname projections, such as `+v/(?<version>*): $<version>+`, or the reserved value `~`.
The `~` values defines a component version as unversioned.
To learn how to specify an unversioned component version, see xref:component-with-no-version.adoc[].

If the `version` key is defined in the component version descriptor file for a component version, it takes precedence over a value defined on the content source in the playbook.
If you prefer the playbook to control the value of the `version` key, don't set the `version` key in the component version descriptor file.

[#named-identifier]
=== Named identifier as version

The following example shows how to assign a named identifier to the `version` key.

.antora.yml with named identifier assigned to version
[#ex-name,yaml]
----
name: star
version: rigel # <.>
----
<.> On a new line, type `version`, directly followed by a colon and a space (`:{sp}`).
Then type the value you want assigned to `version`.

[#semver-identifier]
=== Semantic identifier as version

A semantic identifier is either an integer or begins with an integer and contains at least one dot (`.`).
`10`, `1.0.0`, and `5.1` are all examples of semantic identifiers.
Although a semantic identifier looks like a number, it's actually a string.
If the semantic identifier matches the syntax of a number (integer or decimal), like the one shown in <<ex-semver>>, you should enclose the value in a pair of single quotes (`'`), which coerces it to a string.

The following example shows how to assign a semantic identifier to the `version` key.

.antora.yml with semantic identifier assigned to version
[#ex-semver,yaml]
----
name: colorado
version: '5.6.0' # <.>
----
<.> Enclose a value that matches the syntax of a number in a pair of single quote marks (`'`).

Antora recognizes semantic identifiers according to https://semver.org[semantic versioning rules].
Semantic versioning is often referred to as semver.
Antora allows a semantic identifier to begin with `v`.
Although this prefix is preserved in the value, Antora will ignore it when sorting versions.
For example, `v9.0.2` will be sorted as though the value is `9.0.2`.

[#refname]
=== refname as version

Since content in Antora is retrieved from a git repository, you may want to use the git refname (branch or tag name) in which the component version descriptor is stored as the version.
To do so, assign the reserved value `true` to the version, as shown in <<ex-refname>>.

.antora.yml with true assigned to version
[#ex-refname,yaml]
----
name: colorado
version: true # <.>
----
<.> The value `true` tells Antora to use the refname as the value.

Antora will substitute the value `true` with the refname automatically.
The value Antora uses is always the short refname (e.g., v1.0), not the full refname (e.g., refs/heads/v1.0).
If the short refname contains any forward slashes, Antora will replace each one with a hyphen.

[#refname-projection]
=== refname projection as version

The refname may not be granular enough to use as the version.
Furthermore, the same git tree could be passed through git references that have different naming schemes, such as feature branches.
In these cases, you want the version to be extracted or derived from the refname rather than using the value as is.
That's when you'd define the version using a refname projection.

A refname projection is expressed as a map of patterns (the keys) and replacements (the values).
The refname projection allows you to match the refname using a pattern, then build a version based on that match.
The pattern tells Antora which entry to use and what parts to extract from it.
The replacement tells Antora how to derive a version from the matched refname.

The following example shows how to use a projection to compute the value of the `version` key from the refname.

.antora.yml with version computed from a refname projection
[#ex-projection,yaml]
----
name: colorado
version:
  v(?<version>+({0..9}).+({0..9})).x: $<version> # <.>
  feature/(*)/*: $1 # <.>
----
<.> Matches the semantic identifier in a refname like `v2.0.x` and extracts it
<.> Extracts the value between the first and second slash for a refname that begins with `feature/`

The key in the projection is a glob pattern (a combination of extglobs, ranges, and some regex constructs).
The pattern has the same matching capabilities as the pattern used to match branches or tags for a content source in the playbook.

The characters between parentheses (i.e., round brackets) in the pattern defines a match group.
If the opening brace begins with `?<name>`, that group is assigned to the name specified between the angle brackets.
Otherwise, the group is assigned to a 1-based index according to the group's position in the pattern.

The match groups can be referenced in the replacement.
A match group reference is preceded by a dollar sign (`$`).
A named group can be referenced using `$<name>`, where the name is once again specified between the angle brackets.
An indexed group can be referenced by its number, such as `$1`.
You can reference the entire refname using `$&`.

If the match group contains any forward slashes, Antora will replace each one with a hyphen.

Antora will use the value of the first pattern it matches.
If none of the patterns match the refname, Antora will fallback to using the refname as the version.

[#requirements]
== Value requirements

A literal value assigned to the `version` key can contain letters, numbers, periods (`.`), underscores (`+_+`), and hyphens (`-`).
To ensure portability between host platforms, letters used in the `version` value should be lowercase.

The value *cannot* contain spaces, forward slashes (`/`), or HTML special characters (`&`, `<`, or `>`).
See xref:component-display-version.adoc[] to learn how to represent a version that contains spaces, uppercase letters, and other characters in the UI menus.
