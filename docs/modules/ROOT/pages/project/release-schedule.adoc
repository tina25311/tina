|===

General Availability (GA):: A release line enters general availability on the date an initial, final major version of the software is released and available for download.

Active:: Release line is being actively improved and supported.

Maintenance:: Once a release line enters its maintenance period, only its most recent minor version will receive critical security patch releases.
A release line starts this phase 30 days after the next major release line goes GA.

End of Life (EOL):: The date after which the release line no longer receives support or releases.

== Version policy

Antora follows the semantic versioning rules.
Each Antora component release is versioned *major.minor.patch*.

Major::
Major releases occur when there are substantial changes in functionality or when new functionality breaks backwards compatibility.
Releases within the same major release line will maintain API compatibility.

Minor::
Minor releases add new features, improvements to existing features, and fixes that maintain backwards compatibility.

Patch::
Patch releases fix bugs and maintain backwards compatibility.
Only the latest minor release of a major release line will receive patches.
Patch releases happen as needed depending on the urgency of the fix.

Pre-release::
Major and minor releases may include pre-release versions (major.minor.patch-alpha.n | -beta.n | -rc.n).
Pre-release versions will be tagged as _next_ so that the npm client doesn't prefer a pre-release over a stable version.
Once a release candidate (rc) has been thoroughly tested, the stable release will be published.

TIP: See the xref:project/roadmap.adoc[Roadmap] for some of the notable features and changes scheduled for upcoming Antora releases.
