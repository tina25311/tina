= Antora {page-component-version}.10

_**Release date:** 2024.12.04 | *Issue label:* {url-milestone-3-1-10}[3.1.10^]_

The main focus of this release is to publish a variant of the Antora Docker image compiled for linux/arm64 (which is handled by the docker-antora project pursuit to this release).
The project build was also updated to use Biome instead of ESLint/Prettier, which resulted in some minor changes to the code formatting and style.
Finally, the Antora helper packages were updated, both which require Node.js 16 (the same as this version of Antora).
Other changes from resolved issues are listed below.

== Resolved issues

=== Changed

Issue {url-issues}/1141[#1141^]::
Detect and warn when an AsciiDoc extension is registered as an Antora extension, but do no skip it.
Issue {url-issues}/1157[#1157^]::
Switch from ESLint/Prettier to Biome and update code formatting accordingly.
(no issue)::
Upgrade @antora/expand-path-helper and @antora/user-require-helper dependencies to 3.0.x in various packages.

=== Fixed

Issue {url-issues}/1147[#1147^]::

= Antora {page-component-version}.9

_**Release date:** 2024.07.05 | *Issue label:* {url-milestone-3-1-9}[3.1.9^]_

The focus of this release is to fix changes from the previous release that did not adhere to semantic versioning.
First, the file publisher was updated to work with a virtual file created by vinyl 3, thus fixing compatibility with the PDF extension.
Second, an Asciidoctor extension registered as an Antora extension will be registered rather than skipped, though a warning will still be issued.

= Antora {page-component-version}.0

_**Release date:** 2022.08.22 | *Issue label:* {url-milestone-3-1-0}[3.1.0^]_

The highlights of the Antora {page-component-version}.0 release include:

* raising the minimum version of Node.js to Node.js 16,
* locking down the exported require paths to clearly demarcate the public API,
* adding support for attribute references in the value of xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc#references-in-values[site attributes defined in the playbook] and xref:component-attributes.adoc#references-in-values[component version attributes defined in component version descriptors],
* providing more context to log and error messages and formatting the information consistently,
* including more information about content roots in the model for use by extensions, and
* assigning additional xref:page:intrinsic-attributes.adoc#page-attributes[intrinsic page attributes] that relay more of a page's identity and origin.

You can find a summary of the issues resolved in this release below.

== Resolved issues

Issue {url-issues}/978[#978^]:: Add `origins` property containing unique origin objects to each entry in the content aggregate.
Issue {url-issues}/981[#981^]:: Resolve attribute references in AsciiDoc attributes defined in the xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc#references-in-values[playbook] ([.path]_antora-playbook.yml_) and xref:component-attributes.adoc#references-in-values[component version descriptors] ([.path]_antora.yml_), honoring any escaped attribute references.
Issue {url-issues}/984[#984^]:: Define exports for all packages, locking down what paths can be required to the public API.
Issue {url-issues}/988[#988^]::
* Add `reftype` key with value of branch or tag to source object in structured log message.

* Add `remote` property to origin object to identify a remote tracking branch.
* Add `local` key with path of local repository to source object in structured log message, if applicable.

=== Changed

Issue {url-issues}/900[#900^]:: Include target in error message for broken or cyclic symbolic link in local content source or UI bundle directory.
Issue {url-issues}/979[#979^]:: Set Node.js 16.0.0 as minimum supported Node.js version.
Upgrade dependencies that require Node.js > 12 and remove workarounds.

=== Fixed

* Don't append `undefined` after path of file in stack in pretty log format if line is missing.
* Make warning message about missing page layout consistent with other log messages.

=== Removed

Node.js 12 and 14 support:: Antora no longer supports Node.js < 16 (specifically dropping support for Node.js 12 and 14) since those Node.js release lines are now EOL.
This change is consistent with Antora's Node.js support policy.

== Antora 2 is EOL

*Antora 2 is EOL*.
Review the checklist on xref:install:upgrade-antora.adoc[] to learn about what changes you should make to your source content, including xref:asciidoctor-upgrade-notes.adoc[AsciiDoc syntax and Asciidoctor updates introduced in Asciidoctor 2.2], and Antora configuration prior to upgrading to from Antora 2 to Antora {page-component-version}.
