== Highlights

=== Fix regression when resolving page ID with version and no file extension

If the page ID for an xref had a version but no file extension (e.g., `2.0@page`), the page ID would not resolve.
This happened because the `.` in the version number was confused as that start of a file extension.
Thus the automatic `.adoc` file extension was not added and the page ID would not match an existing page.

What this fix does not solve is when the page (i.e., relative path) part of the page ID has a `.` but no file extension (e.g., `something-2.0`).
This is an ambiguous scenario.
In this case, you will have to update the page ID to include the `.adoc` file extension manually (e.g., `something-2.0.adoc`).

Keep in mind that in Antora 3, all page IDs _must_ have a file extension.
So while this regression has been corrected, this case will not resolve in the future.

=== Support image xref to page ID with fragment

Support for the xref attribute on images was added in Antora 2.3.
However, if the page ID included a fragment identifier (e.g., `page.adoc#anchor`), the value would not be processed as a page ID.
This has now been fixed.

=== Fixed

Issue {url-issues}/635[#635^]:: Fix cases when page ID with no file extension fails to resolve.

= Antora 2.3.1

_**Release date:** 2020.04.29 | *Issue label:* {url-milestone-2-3-1}[2.3.1^]_

== Notices

When Antora 2.3.1 was first released, there was a bug in one of the libraries (gulp-vinyl-zip) that caused Antora running on Windows to write files from the UI bundle to the published site with the ReadOnly attribute set.
This bug, in turn, caused Antora to crash when generating the site a second time without using `--clean` flag.
Adding the `--clean` flag to the `antora` command would circumvent the issue.
Fortunately, this workaround is no longer required.
This bug has been fixed in a patch release.

To apply the fix, uninstall Antora (specifically @antora/site-genrator-default) and install it again.
For details about this problem, and a reference to the upstream issue, refer to issue {url-issues}/631^[#631].

Thanks to Chris Jaquet ({url-gitlab}/chrisjaquet[@chrisjaquet]) for recognizing this issue and providing the necessary information to help us resolve it.

== Highlights

=== Smarter pagination

In tandem with this release, we added a pagination widget to all pages when using the default UI.
This pagination widget allows readers to navigate between adjacent pages (i.e., previous and next page navigation).
The change also includes adding the corresponding next and prev SEO pagination links to the head of the HTML document.

This functionality is currently hidden behind a feature flag.
To enable it, set the `page-pagination` attribute in your playbook (or anywhere an AsciiDoc document attribute can be set).

While developing this functionality, we discovered a few problems with how the `page.previous` and `page.next` properties in the UI model were being computed:

* If the next item in the navigation tree is a fragment of the current page, the pagination widget would get stuck on the current page (since the next property referred back to the current page).
* If the previous item in the navigation tree is a fragment of the previous page, the pagination widget would jump to the fragment on that page, but from there jump to its previous page, skipping over all other fragments (which simply isn't intuitive).
* The next page for the component version start page would not be set if the start page is not present in the navigation tree.
* Conversely, the previous page for the first page in the navigation tree would not be set to the component version start page.

All of these issues have been resolved.

As a general rule of thumb, we recommend avoiding the use of fragments in the site navigation since it mixes static and interactive models.
It's best to rely on the sidebar TOC to provide navigation within the page.

=== Greater portability

One of Antora's dependencies was limiting the platforms on which Antora could be installed.
This dependency (deep-freeze-node) was removed and replaced with an internal implementation (which turned out to be 5 lines of code).
It should now be possible to install Antora on any platform on which Node runs.

The general policy of Antora is to avoid dependencies wherever possible.
This change is not only consistent with that policy, but provides a concrete example for why we follow it.

=== robots.txt generated when site URL is a pathname

If the site URL is a pathname (e.g., _/_) rather than an absolute URL (e.g., _\https://example.org_), the robots exclusion file (i.e., robots.txt) will still be generated.
The robots.txt doesn't require an absolute URL.
Thus, it's enough for the site URL to be set to any allowable value to serve as a hint that the file should be generated.

=== Documentation changes

The site URL, which is defined by the playbook, implicitly controls whether or not certain functionality in Antora is enabled.
The relationship between this setting and the functionality is now more clear.
Specifically, the documentation explains what impact setting the site URL has and lists all the ways it's used.
It also explains the difference between using an absolute URL and a pathname, which functionality requires the former, and when and how a pathname is required in either case.

* xref:playbook:site-url.adoc[]

Several updates have also been made to the default UI which impact the appearance of the documentation.
In particular, hyphenation has been disabled for monospaced phrases.
This change will avoid confusion by removing erroneous hyphens in the option names shown on the xref:cli:index.adoc[] page.

= Antora 2.3.0

_**Release date:** 2020.04.23 | *Issue label:* {url-milestone-2-3-0}[2.3.0^]_

== Highlights

=== Declare attributes per component version

You can now set or unset attributes on all pages in a single component version by defining them in the [.path]_antora.yml_ file for that component version.
Component version attributes can be xref:page:attributes.adoc[built-in, custom, or page attributes].
These attributes are applied (either available or, if unset, unavailable) on all of a component version's pages according to the xref:component-attributes.adoc#precedence-rules[attribute precedence rules].
Here's an example to give you an idea of how this looks:

.antora.yml that defines AsciiDoc document attributes for a component version
[source,yaml]
----
name: light
title: Data Light
version: '2.3'
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    listing-caption: false
    table-caption: Data Set@
    hide-uri-scheme: ''
    toc: ~
    page-level: Advanced
    page-category: 'Statistics, Cloud Infrastructure'
----

Since attributes can now be defined at multiple levels, Antora 2.3 adds the ability to soft set and unset xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[site attributes] as well as xref:component-attributes.adoc[component version attributes].

With this improved scoping and tuning, page attributes are now more versatile.
One of the primary roles of page attributes is to pass metadata about the page to the UI template via the UI model.
The UI template can xref:page:page-attributes.adoc#access-attributes-from-ui-template[use the information provided by the page attributes] in a variety of ways, from populating metadata in the published page to toggling or configuring behavior in the UI.

See xref:component-attributes.adoc[], xref:playbook:asciidoc-attributes.adoc[], and
xref:page:page-attributes.adoc[] to learn more.

=== The new start_paths playbook key for content sources

The new `start_paths` key allows you to specify multiple content source roots per reference (branch or tag) of a content source.
In other words, you can put multiple components or component versions--each with its own [.path]_antora.yml_ file--in a single branch or tag of a repository, and define them using a single content source entry in your playbook.

In addition to exact paths, the `start_paths` supports discovery by accepting xref:playbook:content-source-start-paths.adoc#path-globbing[glob patterns], including wildcards, braces, and negated patterns.
See xref:playbook:content-source-start-paths.adoc[] to learn more.

=== Page aliases work in xrefs

The target of an xref macro can now be a page alias, which is then transparently resolved to its corresponding page.
Page aliases, which are expressed using the same syntax as a page ID, are defined using the `page-aliases` attribute in the document header.
See xref:page:page-aliases.adoc[] to learn more.

=== Default xref link text for pages and navigation files

Antora now uses the xref:page:reftext-and-navtitle.adoc[target page's reftext] when the link text in an xref macro isn't specified.
For instance, the following xref example doesn't have any link text specified.

[source]
----
See xref:component-prerelease.adoc[].
----

But notice in the output below that Antora automatically used the target page's title to fill in the link text when it generated the site.

====
See xref:component-prerelease.adoc[].
====

By default, the `reftext` attribute is assigned the page's title as its value.
You can also assign a page a xref:page:reftext-and-navtitle.adoc[custom reftext value] using an attribute entry.

Xrefs in navigation files behave the same way with one additional feature.
Navigation files first look for the value of the xref:page:reftext-and-navtitle.adoc#navtitle[navtitle attribute] of the target page to populate the link text.
If the `navtitle` attribute isn't set, then the page's `reftext` value is used instead.
You never have to explicitly set `reftext` or `navtitle` unless you want to customize the default xref link text used in a page or navigation file.

=== xrefs can target non-AsciiDoc-based pages

If you're using a custom generator to register non-AsciiDoc page files (such as HTML files), you can now use the xref macro to link to these pages.
The syntax looks just like an xref to an AsciiDoc-based page, except the target must end in `.html#` instead of `.adoc` (e.g., `\xref:the-page.html#[The Page]`).
This feature is mostly forward looking for when Antora supports importing and processing prepared content, but can be useful to have now if you're building on top of Antora.

=== On this page widget

The default UI now offers an "`on this page`" widget (aka TOC).
You can see it on this page.
The TOC lists all the section titles on the page down to the specified level and features a scroll spy that shows which section is currently active.
When the page is not wide enough (such as on a mobile screen), the TOC is shown below the page title instead of in the sidebar.

The TOC is enabled by default.
Here are ways you can configure the sidebar TOC:

* Configure the text of the heading shown above the TOC using the page attribute named `page-toctitle` (default: "Contents")
* Set the number of levels tracked by the TOC using the page attribue named `page-toclevels` (0 - 3) (default: 2)
* Disable the TOC per page (or side-wide) by setting the page attribue named `page-toclevels` to -1
* Alternately, disable the TOC by adding the `-toc` class to the `<body>` element in the HTML template

You can also control where the embedded TOC is inserted by adding the class `is-before-toc` to an element after the doctitle (selector: `h1.page`).
The embedded TOC is *not* added if an element is found with the ID `toc`.

If you want to add the TOC to your own UI, feel free to grab the MPL-2.0-licensed https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/blob/master/src/js/02-on-this-page.js[02-on-this-page.js] script and customize it to suit your needs pursuant to the license terms.

[#deprecation]
== Deprecations scheduled for Antora 3.0

Per the normal xref:install:supported-platforms.adoc[supported platforms policy], support for Node 8, and likely Node 10 as well, will be dropped.

The ability to use parent references in the target of the AsciiDoc image macro (e.g., `image::../../../module-b/_images/image-filename.png[]`) will be removed in Antora 3.0.
You should begin replacing any such image targets with resource IDs.

Antora has added the _.adoc_ file extension to a xref:page:page-id.adoc#id-coordinates[page coordinate] in page aliases and xrefs whenever it wasn't specified by the writer.
This fallback mechanism will be deprecated in Antora 3.0 to make way for using non-AsciiDoc pages in the xref facility.
You should review the page IDs in your xrefs and `page-aliases` attributes to ensure the _.adoc_ extension is specified.

The `classifyContent` function will expect the site-wide AsciiDoc config as the third argument.

The following deprecated methods will be removed from the `ContentCatalog`: `getComponentMap`, `getComponentMapSortedBy`, and `getFiles`.
