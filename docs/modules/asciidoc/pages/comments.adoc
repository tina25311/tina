* [x] How write a comment line or block in an AsciiDoc file.

== Comment syntax

You can use a comment line or comment block when you want to add text to an AsciiDoc source file, but don't want that text to be displayed when the file is converted to an HTML page.
Comments inside blocks that have the verbatim (e.g., listing) or raw (e.g., pass) content model are not interpreted.

A comment line is denoted by two consecutive forward slashes (`//`) at the beginning of a line.

.Comment line syntax

A comment block is delimited by a set of four consecutive forward slashes (`////`).

.Comment block syntax
----

All of the text, including any AsciiDoc syntax, won't be visible when the file is converted to HTML.
