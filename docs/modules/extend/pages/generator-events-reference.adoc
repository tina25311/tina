:navtitle: Generator Events Reference

Antora extensions listen for events emitted by the generator when Antora runs.
Each listener can access variables that are in scope at the time the event is emitted.
The following table lists the generator events in the order they're emitted and the context (in-scope) variables that correspond to each event.
If the variable is locked, meaning it cannot be replaced, it's italicized.

|register(){empty}footnote:register[The register function isn't an event, but rather the function Antora calls on an extension so it can register listeners.]

|playbook

|playbookBuilt
|playbook

|contextStopped
|(any variable still in scope at the time the context is stopped)

|===

The playbook object (i.e., the parsed data from the playbook file) is available at the time the `register` function is called (which acts like the `register` event).
However, at this stage, the playbook is still just a raw data model.
The Antora extensions have yet to be registered.
When the `contextStarted` is emitted, all the initialization of the playbook, including registering Antora extensions and generator functions, is complete.

When modifying the content sources in an Antora extension, it's customary to use the `playbookBuilt` event.
After that, the playbook object cannot be modified or updated.

In addition to the built-in context variables listed in this table, your extension can also access context variables documented and promoted by other extensions.
