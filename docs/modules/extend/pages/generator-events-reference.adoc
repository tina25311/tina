= Generator Lifecycle Events Reference
:navtitle: Generator Events Reference

Antora extensions listen for events emitted by the generator when Antora runs.
Each listener can access variables that are in scope at the time the event is emitted.
The following table lists the generator events in the order they're emitted and the context (in-scope) variables that correspond to each event.
If the variable is locked, meaning it cannot be replaced, it's italicized.
