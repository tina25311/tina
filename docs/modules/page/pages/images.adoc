//:page-aliases: asciidoc:insert-image.adoc

Images are source files, such as photographs, diagrams, and screenshots, that are stored in an xref:ROOT:images-directory.adoc[_images_ family directory].
An image can be inserted into any page or partial, regardless of the module or component version it belongs to, using an AsciiDoc image macro.
AsciiDoc supports the PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF (static and animated) image file formats.
It's also possible to create a link to an image using the xref macro.

== Block and inline image macros

There are two AsciiDoc image macro types, block and inline.
A xref:block-images.adoc[block image] is displayed as a discrete element on a page.

.Block image macro
----
This is a paragraph.

image::resource-id-of-target-image.ext[]
----

An xref:inline-images.adoc[inline image] is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a paragraph or sidebar block.

.Inline image macro
----
This sentence contains an inline image:resource-id-of-target-image.ext[] image.
----

== Link to a resource from an image macro

Using the `xref` element attribute, you can reference a page, attachment, element, or even another image from an image embedded in a page.
