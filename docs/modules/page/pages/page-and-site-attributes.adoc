= Page and Site Attributes
//TODO provide example of user-defined page attribute

Attributes that are prefixed with `page-` are cataloged by Antora and available to both the page they're set on and the pipeline components during site generation.
These attributes are helpful when passing data from a page to the site UI and integrations, such as a search service.
In addition to user-defined page attributes, Antora also provides built-in page attributes.

[#page-attributes]
== Built-in Antora attributes

Antora sets the following attributes for each page:

`page-component-name`:: The name of the component as specified in _antora.yml_.
`page-component-version`:: The version of the component as specified in _antora.yml_.
`page-component-title`:: The title (aka display name) of the component as specified in  _antora.yml_.
`page-version`:: Shorthand for `page-component-version` (since Antora 1.1.1).
`page-module`:: The name of the module where the page is located.
`page-relative`:: The family-relative source path of the page.
`page-origin-type`:: The content source type (e.g., git).
`page-origin-url`:: The content source URL (i.e., the URL of the git repository).
`page-origin-start-path`:: The path where the component is located in the repository.
`page-origin-refname`:: The name of the reference where the page is located in the repository.
`page-origin-branch`:: The shortname of the branch where the page is located in the repository.
`page-origin-tag`:: The tag where this page is located in the repository (mutually exclusive with branch)
`page-origin-reftype`:: The reference type where the page is located in the repository (tag or branch).
`page-origin-worktree`:: Set if the file was taken from the git worktree.

These attributes are available to the pipeline during processing and can be referenced in a page.
