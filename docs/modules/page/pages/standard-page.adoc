= Set Up a Standard Page
:page-aliases: create-standard-page.adoc
:listing-caption!:

A standard page has two parts, a header and a body.

[#page-header]
== Page header

The page header is a set of contiguous lines that start on the first line of the file.
The header encapsulates the following elements:

* A required xref:title-and-metadata.adoc[page title]
* Optional xref:title-and-metadata.adoc[metadata attributes], such as a page description and author information
* Optional xref:attributes.adoc[built-in attributes], like `xrefstyle` and `page-aliases`
* Optional xref:attributes.adoc[custom attributes] where the attribute name and value are defined by you

.Common elements in a page header
----
= Page Title <.>
:description: A description of the page stored in an HTML meta tag. <.>
:sectanchors: <.>
:url-repo: https://my-git-repo.com <.>
:page-tags: name of a tag, name of a tag <.>
----
<.> Required page title entered on the first line of the file
<.> Optional built-in `description` metadata attribute
<.> Optional built-in AsciiDoc attribute
<.> Optional custom AsciiDoc attribute
<.> Optional custom Antora `page-` attribute

The page title must be defined using an Atx-style (single line) document title that begins with a single equals sign.
Antora does not recognize the legacy Setext-style (two line) document title syntax once supported by AsciiDoc.
If you use the Setext-style syntax, xrefs in the page will not be resolved and other features of AsciiDoc will not be available.

The attribute entries, whether built-in or custom, must each be entered on its own line.
The header can also contain xref:asciidoc:comments.adoc[comment lines].

The page header ends by entering one or more blank lines.

== Page body

The page header is separated from the page body by at least one blank line.
The next line that contains content initiates the body of the page.

----
= Page Title
:description: A description of the page stored in an HTML meta tag.
:sectanchors:
:url-repo: https://my-git-repo.com
:page-tags: name of a tag, name of a tag
<.>
This is the first line of the page body. <.>

== Section heading

This is a paragraph in a section.
----
<.> A blank line ends the page header.
<.> After the blank line, the next line with content starts the body or the page.

The first line of the page body can be any valid AsciiDoc content, such as a section heading, paragraph, table, include directive, image, etc.

== Page filename

A page is stored in a [.path]_pages_ family directory.
The page's filename is used to compute its URL.
If the filename begins with a dot (.) or ends without a file extension, xref:ROOT:standard-directories.adoc#hidden-files[Antora will ignore it].
If the filename starts with an underscore (`+_+`), it will be added to the content catalog, but xref:ROOT:standard-directories.adoc#hidden-files[Antora won't publish it].

== Create a new standard page

. Open a new file in your preferred IDE or plain text editor.

. On the first line of the file, enter a page title.
A page title is specified by one equals sign (`=`), followed by one blank space, and then the text of the title.
+
----
= The Title of My New Page
----

. *The page title is the only required header element.*
Separate the header block from the body block by one blank line.
Write your content.
+
----
= The Title of My New Page

Welcome to my new page!
----

. Save the file with the extension `.adoc` in a [.path]_pages_ directory.
The name you use when saving the file will be used to compute the page's URL.

You've created a standard page!
When you run Antora, it will be converted to an HTML page and published to your site automatically.

The page created in this example is simple.
Using AsciiDoc, a page's header can encompass a wide range of capabilities and its body can handle complex content.

.Key Points to Remember
====
A page:

* is stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory of a module
* has the _.adoc_ file extension
* has a filename that only contains URL-compliant characters
* has a filename that's all lowercase (optional, but recommended)
* has a filename that does not contain spaces (optional, but recommended)
* has a title (i.e., document title)
* is marked up using valid AsciiDoc syntax

Using spaces in the filename is not recommended.
Spaces have to be encoded in a URL and this can lead to URLs which look unfamiliar to visitors.
It's best to avoid spaces (and only use lowercase letters) when choosing a filename for a page.
====

//If you want a site visitor to locate this page via a component navigation menu, you'll need to add a link to the page (`xref`) to a xref:navigation:index.adoc[navigation file].
