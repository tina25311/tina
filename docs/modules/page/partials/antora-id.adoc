[#id-version]
version@::
The first coordinate identifies the version of the component to which the target {family} belongs.
The version is specified by the xref:ROOT:component-version-key.adoc[version key] in the [.path]_antora.yml_ file that defines the {family}'s component version.
The version coordinate is directly followed by an at sign (`@`).

[#id-component]
component{colon}::
The second coordinate identifies the name of the component to which the target {family} belongs.
The component name is specified by the xref:ROOT:component-name-key.adoc[name key] in the [.path]_antora.yml_ file that defines the {family}'s component version.
The component name is directly followed by one colon (`:`).

[#id-module]
module{colon}::
The third coordinate identifies the name of the module to which the target {family} belongs.
The module name is derived from the xref:ROOT:module-directories.adoc#module[module directory] where the {family} is stored.
The module name is directly followed by one colon (`:`).

// tag::resource[]
[#id-family]
family$::
The fourth coordinate identifies the name of the family to which the target {family} belongs.
The family is derived from the xref:ROOT:family-directories.adoc[family directory] where the {family} is stored.
Remove the "`s`" at the end of the family's name and replace it with a dollar sign (`$`) when constructing a resource ID.
Whether or not the family coordinate needs to be specified xref:page:resource-id.adoc#requires-family-coordinate[depends on the AsciiDoc syntax used to reference the resource].

[#id-resource]
resource.ext::
The fifth coordinate specifies the path, relative to the xref:ROOT:family-directories.adoc[family directory], of the target resource's source file.
The filename must include the file extension.
// end::resource[]

// tag::page[]
[#id-page]
page.adoc::
The fourth coordinate specifies the path relative to the xref:ROOT:pages-directory.adoc[_pages_ family directory] of the target page's source file.
If both the source page and the target page are located in the same subdirectory (i.e., topic path) of the _pages_ family directory, the path coordinate still must be specified relative to the _pages_ directory.
You can add `./` to the start of this segment as a shorthand for the topic path of the source page.
The filename must include the _.adoc_ file extension.
// end::page[]
// end::id[]
