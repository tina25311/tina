= Runtime Keys

The playbook keys configured under the `runtime` key manage Antora's logger, as well as its console output, caching, and remote repository update behavior.

[#runtime-key]
== runtime key

The global log, console output, fetch, and cache directory properties are defined under the `runtime` key in a playbook file.
These settings are applied to the Antora pipeline when it starts.

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
runtime: # <.>
  cache_dir: ./.cache/antora # <.>
  fetch: true # <.>
  log: # <.>
    level: error # <.>
  quiet: true # <.>
----
<.> Optional `runtime` key
<.> Optional `cache_dir` key
<.> Optional `fetch` key
<.> Optional `log` key
<.> Optional `level` key
<.> Optional `quiet` key

The `runtime` key and the key-value pairs it accepts are optional.
If `runtime` isn't set in the playbook, Antora uses the default cache directory, fetch, and log settings.
Alternatively, these keys can be assigned from the xref:cli:options.adoc#generate-options[CLI] or, except for `fetch`, using xref:playbook:environment-variables.adoc[environment variables].

[#log-key]
== log key

The `log` key is optional.
If you do set it in the playbook, you must nest it under the <<runtime-key,runtime key>>.
The `log` key accepts a list of built-in key-value pairs that configure the log level (`level`), failure level (`failure_level`), and display format (`format`).

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
runtime:
  log: # <.>
    format: json # <.>
    failure_level: warn # <.>
    level: all # <.>
    level_format: number # <.>
    destination: # <.>
      file: ./antora.log # <.>
      append: true # <.>
      buffer_size: 4096 # <.>
      sync: false # <.>
----
<.> The optional `log` category key is nested under the `runtime` category key.
<.> The optional `format` key is nested under the `log` category key.
<.> The optional `failure_level` key is nested under the `log` category key.
<.> The optional `level` key is nested under the `log` category key.
<.> The optional `level_format` key is nested under the `log` category key.
<.> The optional `destination` category key is nested under the `log` category key.
<.> The optional `file` key is nested under the `destination` category key.
<.> The optional `append` key is nested under the `destination` category key.
<.> The optional `buffer_size` key is nested under the `destination` category key.
<.> The optional `sync` key is nested under the `destination` category key.

If `level`, `failure_level`, `format`, or `level_format` are set in the playbook, they must be nested under the `log` category key.
The xref:runtime-log-level.adoc#default[level], xref:runtime-log-failure-level.adoc#default[failure_level], xref:runtime-log-format.adoc#default[format], and xref:runtime-log-format.adoc#level-format-key[level_format] keys have default values that are automatically applied when Antora runs if they're not explicitly defined in the playbook or using the corresponding the xref:cli:options.adoc#generate-options[command line options] or xref:playbook:environment-variables.adoc[environment variables].

If `file`, `append`, `buffer_size`, or `sync` are set in the playbook, they must be nested under the `destination` category key.

IMPORTANT: The log settings are not honored if a fatal error is thrown before Antora fully configures the playbook.
In such cases, the error message is only printed directly to standard error (stderr) using a preconfigured logger.

[#quiet-key]
== quiet key

The `quiet` key is optional.
If you do set it in the playbook, you must nest it under the <<runtime-key,runtime key>>.
The `quiet` key accepts a boolean value.
If the value is true, informational messages such as the git progress and build completion message are not written to stdout (i.e., the standard output stream) of the console.
In short, no messages are written directly stdout when this key is set to true.

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
runtime:
  quiet: true # <.>
----
<.> The optional `quiet` key is nested under the `runtime` category key.

This flag does not impact messages written to stderr.
Messages will still be written to the log, which may then be routed to stdout depending on the log configuration.

[#silent-key]
== silent key

The `silent` key is optional.
If you do set it in the playbook, you must nest it under the <<runtime-key,runtime key>>.
The `silent` key accepts a boolean value.
If the value is true, the log level is set to `silent` (and cannot be overridden) and any messages written directly to stdout and stderr are suppressed.
In short, all messages to the console and log are suppressed.

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
runtime:
  silent: true # <.>
----
<.> The optional `silent` key is nested under the `runtime` category key.

You should not expect to see any messages in the console when the value of this key is true.

[cols="3,6,1"]
|===
|Runtime Keys |Description |Required

|xref:runtime-cache-dir.adoc[cache_dir]
|Specifies the directory where the remote content sources git repositories and UI bundles are cached.
|No

|xref:runtime-fetch.adoc[fetch]
|When set to `true`, the `fetch` key refreshes the files in the cache each time Antora runs.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-failure-level.adoc[log.failure_level]
|Sets the log level tolerance that, when met or exceeded, causes Antora to fail on exit with a non-zero exit code.
Accepts the values `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `none`.
The default value is `fatal`.
The value `none` causes Antora to always exit with a zero exit code.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-format.adoc[log.format]
|Sets the format of log messages.
Accepts the values `pretty` and `json`.
The default value is `json` in a CI environment and `pretty` in all other environments.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-level.adoc[log.level]
|Sets the minimum severity threshold level that must be met for a message to be logged.
Accepts the values `all`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `silent`.
The default value is `warn`.
The value `silent` turns the logger off.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-format.adoc#level-format-key[log.level_format]
|Sets the format of how the log levels are expressed.
Only applies when `log.format` is `json`.
Accepts the values `label` and `number`.
The default value is `label`.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-destination.adoc#file-key[log.destination.file]
|Sets the destination file or stream where log messages are written.
The default value (either `stdout` or `stderr`) depends on the log format.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-destination.adoc#append-key[log.destination.append]
|Configures whether to truncate (i.e., clear) the file before writing to it.
The default value is `false`, which means to truncate the file.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-destination.adoc#buffer-size-key[log.destination.buffer_size]
|Sets the amount of memory to use to buffer log messages.
Once the buffer reaches this size, the buffered messages are written to the destination in a batch.
The default value is `0`, which turns off this behavior.
|No

|xref:runtime-log-destination.adoc#sync-key[log.destination.sync]
|Configures whether to use a sync or async operation to write log messages to the destination.
The default value is `true`, which means log messages are written synchronously (blocking).
|No

|quiet
|Prevents any messages from being written to stdout.
The default value is `false` (messages are written to stdout).
|No

|silent
|Suppresses all messages, including log messages (by forcefully setting the log level to silent).
The default value is `false`.
|No
