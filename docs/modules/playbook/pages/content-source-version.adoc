= Fallback Version

The `version` key provides a way to control the component version that corresponds to a content source directly from the playbook.
The `version` key on the content source is a fallback value.
If a component version descriptor (an [.path]_antora.yml_ file) defines the `version` key for a component version, the value of that key takes precedence.

== version key

The `version` key is optional.
The `version` key accepts a named identifier, such as `jesse`, a semantic identifier, such as `'1.5'`, the reserved value `~` (for unversioned), the reserved value `true`, or a map of refname projections, such as `+v/(?<version>*): $<version>+`.

A content source can match multiple git references.
Thus, a fixed value should only be used if the content source is configured to match a single reference, or if all the references it matches contribute files to the same component version.
Otherwise, the value of this key should be `true` or a map of refname projections.

If you want the playbook to be able to control the value of the `version` key, don't set the `version` key in xref:ROOT:component-version-descriptor.adoc[the component version descriptor (_antora.yml_ file)].

=== Fixed value as version

The following example shows how to assign a fixed fallback value to the `version` key.
A fixed value can be a named identifier, a semantic identifier, or the value `~` for unversioned.

.Content source with a fixed value assigned to version
[#ex-name,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-a.git
    branches: v2.0.x # <.>
    version: '2.0' # <.>
----
<.> Only match a single reference when using a fixed value.
<.> Assign a fixed value, such as a named identifier, semantic identifier, or the value `~`.

When Antora looks for the component version descriptor in the specified branch (i.e., `v2.0`), it will not expect to find the `version` key defined in that file.
Instead, it will use the fixed value of the `version` key specified on the content source (i.e., `2.0`).

=== refname as version

Since content in Antora is retrieved from a git repository, you may want to use the git refname (branch or tag name) for the content source (where the xref:ROOT:component-version-descriptor.adoc[component version descriptor is stored]) as the version.
To do so, assign the reserved value `true` to the `version` key.
Antora will substitute the value `true` with the refname automatically.

The following example shows how to use the refname as the fallback value of the `version` key.

.Content source that uses the refname as the version
[#ex-refname,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-b.git
    branches: v* # <.>
    version: true # <.>
----
<.> Match any number of references.
<.> The value `true` tells Antora to use the matched refname as the value.

When Antora looks for the component version descriptor in the specified branch (i.e., `v2.0`), it will not expect to find the `version` key defined in that file.
Instead, it will use the refname instead.
The value Antora uses is always the short refname (e.g., v1.0), not the full refname (e.g., refs/heads/v1.0).
If the short refname contains any forward slashes, Antora will replace each one with a hyphen.

=== refname projection as version

The refname may not be granular enough to use as the fallback version.
Furthermore, the same git tree could be passed through git references that have different naming schemes, such as feature branches.
In these cases, you want the version to be extracted or derived from the refname rather than using the value as is.
That's when you'd define the fallback version using a refname projection.

A refname projection is expressed as a map of patterns (the keys) and replacements (the values).
The refname projection allows you to match the refname using a pattern, then build the version based on that match.
The pattern tells Antora which entry to use and what parts to extract from it.
The replacement tells Antora how to derive a version from the matched refname.

The following example shows how to use a projection to compute the value of the `version` key from the refname.

.Content source that derives version from refname
[#ex-projection,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://git-service.com/org/repo-c.git
    branches: [v*, feature/*] # <.>
    version:
      v(?<version>+({0..9}).+({0..9})).x: $<version> # <.>
      feature/(*)/*: $1 # <.>
----
<.> Match any number of references with different naming patterns.
<.> Matches the semantic identifier in a refname like `v2.0.x` and extracts it.
<.> Extracts the value between the first and second slash for a refname that begins with `feature/`

The key in the projection is a glob pattern (a combination of extglobs, ranges, and some regex constructs).
The pattern has the same matching capabilities as the pattern used to match branches or tags for a content source in the playbook.

The characters between parentheses (i.e., round brackets) in the pattern defines a match group.
If the opening brace begins with `?<name>`, that group is assigned to the name specified between the angle brackets.
Otherwise, the group is assigned to a 1-based index according to the group's position in the pattern.

The match groups can be referenced in the replacement.
A match group reference is preceded by a dollar sign (`$`).
A named group can be referenced using `$<name>`, where the name is once again specified between the angle brackets.
An indexed group can be referenced by its number, such as `$1`.
You can reference the entire refname using `$&`.

If the match group contains any forward slashes, Antora will replace each one with a hyphen.

Antora will use the value of the first pattern it matches.
If none of the patterns match the refname, Antora will fallback to using the refname as the version.

TIP: Antora supports matching refnames using wildcards, exclusions, braces, alternation, ranges, and repetition patterns.
