= Git Fetch Depth

The `fetch_depth` key tells Antora how much of the history of a remote repository to fetch.

[#default]
== Default git fetch depth

By default, Antora will only fetch the latest commit when cloning a repository.
When fetching, Antora will only fetch as many commits as needed to get the latest commit.

[#fetch-depth-key]
== fetch_depth key

If you want to increase the number of recent commits Antora fetches from a remote repository, set the `fetch_depth` key to a positive integer.

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
git:
  fetch_depth: 10
----

If you want Antora to fetch the full history, set the value of this key to `0`.

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
git:
  fetch_depth: 0
