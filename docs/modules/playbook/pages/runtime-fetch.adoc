= Fetch Updates

Use the `fetch` key whenever you want to retrieve updates from the remote content sources repositories and UI bundle snapshots.

== Fetch operations

Activating the `fetch` key from a playbook or the CLI causes Antora to perform both of the following actions each time it runs:

. Clone or run a fetch operation for all remote content sources repositories that Antora has cloned.
. (Re)download the remote UI bundle if it's marked as a xref:ui-bundle-url.adoc#snapshot[snapshot].

Antora only fetches updates for remote content sources since the clones are managed by Antora.
Antora never fetches updates for local content sources (i.e., local git repositories).
In other words, Antora does not run `git fetch` or `git pull` on a local git repository.
Doing so would runs the risk of putting them into an inconsistent state or otherwise interfering with the author's work.
Antora leaves managing the state of local content repositories up to the author.

[#fetch-key]
== fetch key

The first time Antora runs a playbook, it clones any remote content sources git repositories and downloads the UI bundle into the xref:runtime-cache-dir.adoc[Antora cache directory].
On subsequent runs, Antora resolves these resources in the cache folder, effectively running offline.

You can instruct Antora to refresh the cache by setting the optional `fetch` key to `true`.
The `fetch` key is configured under the xref:configure-runtime.adoc[runtime key] in a playbook.

.antora-playbook.yml
[,yaml]
----
runtime:
  fetch: true

[#fetch-option]
== Fetch option

You don't have to modify the playbook file directly to set this key.
You can use the `--fetch` option from the xref:cli:options.adoc#fetch[CLI].

 $ antora --fetch antora-playbook.yml

The `--fetch` option overrides the value assigned to the `fetch` key in the playbook file.
