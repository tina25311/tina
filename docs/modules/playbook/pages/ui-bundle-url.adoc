= UI Bundle URL
:url-zip-file-format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)

A UI bundle is a {url-zip-file-format}[ZIP archive] or directory that contains one or more UIs for a site.
The only required file in the UI bundle is the default layout for pages (e.g., [.path]_layouts/default.hbs_) (and, if the 404 page is enabled, [.path]_layouts/404.hbs_ as well).
Antora automatically fetches and loads a UI bundle when generating a site.

[#url-key]
== url key

The `url` key is required.
This key is configured under the xref:configure-ui.adoc[bundle key] of the ui category key in a playbook.
The `url` key accepts a URL or filesystem path from where Antora can locate and fetch the site's UI bundle.
The filesystem path must point to a ZIP archive or a local directory where the ZIP archive has been extracted.

.antora-playbook.adoc
[source,yaml]
----
ui: # <.>
  bundle: # <.>
    url: https://repo.org/path/to/a-ui-bundle.zip # <.>
----
<.> Enter the parent key `ui`, followed by a colon (`:`), and then press kbd:[Enter].
<.> The `bundle` key is a child of `ui`.
Enter the key's name, `bundle`, followed by a colon (`:`), and then press kbd:[Enter].
<.> The `url` key is a child of `bundle`.
Enter `url`, followed by a colon and a blank space (`:{sp}`), and then enter a URL or filesystem path value.

Alternatively, the `url` key can be assigned from the xref:cli:options.adoc#ui-bundle[CLI].

The UI bundle can be augmented using a xref:ui-supplemental-files.adoc[supplemental UI].

[#remote-bundle]
== Load a remote bundle

When the value of `url` is a remote URL, Antora downloads and caches the UI bundle the first time it runs.
In this case, the target must be a ZIP archive.

.Remote UI bundle
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://repo.org/path/to/a-ui-bundle.zip
----

The UI bundle is cached based on the signature of the URL.
On subsequent runs, Antora loads the bundle from the cache as long as the value of `url` remains unchanged.
This saves Antora from having to download the bundle each time you generate your site.

[#snapshot]
=== Use a snapshot

Antora won't download the UI bundle again if it exists in the cache, even when xref:runtime-fetch.adoc[fetch] is enabled.
If the `url` value remains the same, but the archive it points to changes over time, the UI bundle needs to be identified as a snapshot to bypass this cache.

In order to retrieve UI bundle updates without changing the `url` value, you need to enable the `snapshot` key adjacent to the `url` key.
By default, snapshot is not enabled (set to `false`).
When snapshot is set to `true`, Antora will download the UI bundle whenever the xref:runtime-fetch.adoc#fetch-key[fetch key] under the `runtime` category of the playbook is enabled.
The xref:runtime-fetch.adoc#fetch-key[fetch key] instructs Antora to retrieve updates (including the UI bundle snapshot).

.Remote UI bundle marked as a snapshot
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
----

TIP: If you're using Antora's reference UI bundle, you should mark the bundle as a snapshot because its URL never changes.

If you want to control when Antora retrieves updates, pass the `--fetch` option when invoking the `antora` command.
To make this setting permanent, set the `runtime.fetch` key in the playbook to `true`.

.Fetch updates as persistent setting
[,yaml]
----
runtime:
  fetch: true
----

The snapshot key is only required if you're referring to a remote bundle (which Antora caches by default).
If you're referencing a bundle from the filesystem, Antora will always use the file specified.

[#custom-http-headers]
=== Setting Custom HTTP Headers

Antora can be configured to send custom HTTP headers when downloading the UI bundle, e.g. to send a specific accept header for multipurpose URLs such as offered by the https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-release-asset[GitHub API].

.Remote UI bundle with custom HTTP headers
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://api.github.com/repos/antora/antora/releases/assets/120830829
    custom_headers:
      - header: 'accept'
        value: 'application/octet-stream'
      - header: 'X-GitHub-Api-Version'
        value: '2022-11-28'
----

[#local-bundle]
== Load a bundle from the filesystem

The `url` key can reference a local UI bundle using an absolute or relative filesystem path.

.Relative UI bundle path
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: ./../docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip
----

include::partial$relative-path-rules.adoc[]

Here's the path to the same UI bundle, but using an absolute path instead.

.Absolute UI bundle path
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: /home/user/projects/docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip
----

Here's the path to the location where the UI bundle has been extracted (or it was organized with the same layout as an extracted archive).

.Extracted UI bundle path
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: ./../docs-ui/build/ui-bundle-extracted
----

Loading the UI bundle from a local directory is a good way to debug the logic.

[#start-path-key]
== start_path key

The `start_path` key is mapped to the `bundle` key.
It accepts a the relative path inside the UI bundle from where Antora should start reading files.
This key is useful when a UI bundle packages multiple UIs (e.g., light, dark, etc.).

.Select UI from start_path
[,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: /home/user/projects/docs-ui/build/ui-bundle-with-themes.zip
    start_path: dark
----

In this example, Antora will ignore all of the files in the UI bundle that fall outside the [.path]_dark_ directory.
